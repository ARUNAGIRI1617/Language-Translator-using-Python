You can easily translate any language using Google translator, but creating your translator will be a satisfying experience as a programmer.To make our own Google Translator we need to install two libraries in python Google Translator API and Streamlit.You can use this API for every task that you can do with the google translator. You can easily install this library in your systems by using the "pip install google_trans_new" command. To make a translator more interactive we will also create an interactive user interface by using the streamlit library in Python.
